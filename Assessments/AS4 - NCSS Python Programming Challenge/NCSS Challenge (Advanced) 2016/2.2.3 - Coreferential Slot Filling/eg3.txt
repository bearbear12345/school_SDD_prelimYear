Completing [his][1] resemblance to a [man][2] who was sitting for [his][2] portrait,
[Mr. Lorry][1] dropped off to sleep. The arrival of [his][1] breakfast roused [him][1],
and [he][1] said to the drawer, as [he][1] moved [his][1] chair to it:

"I wish accommodation prepared for a young [lady][3] who may come here at any
time to-day. [She][3] may ask for [Mr. Jarvis Lorry][1], or [she][3] may only ask for a
[gentleman][1] from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know."

                                     ....

"Yes, [sir][1]. Not much in the habit of such travelling [yourself][1], [I][0] think, [sir][1]?"

"Not of late years. It is fifteen years since [I][1] came last from France."

"Indeed, [sir][1]? That was before [my][0] time here, [sir][1]. Before our people's
time here, [sir][1]. The George was in other hands at that time, [sir][1]."
